RSTTool Derivative for Discussion Annotations
=============================================

This program is a derivative of [Daniel Marcu's
modification](http://www.isi.edu/publications/licensed-sw/RSTTool/) of
the original [RSTTool](http://www.wagsoft.com/RSTTool/) by Michael
O'Donell.  This derivative provides a broader functionality for
annotatating multilogues (i.e. dialogues with multiple participants).
The user can view multilogues in a successive fashion (i.e. reply by
reply) and can annotate RST-relations both within and among the
replies.
